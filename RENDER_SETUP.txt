RENDER DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS:

When creating web service on Render, use these:

Build Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command:
gunicorn server:app

That's it! Render will auto-detect Python and deploy.

After deployment, copy your URL (e.g., https://yt-downloader-xyz.onrender.com)
and update extension/popup.js line 17 with that URL.
