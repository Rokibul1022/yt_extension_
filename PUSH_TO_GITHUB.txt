1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "yt-downloader-ext"
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
4. Click "Create repository"

5. Copy the commands GitHub shows and run in terminal:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/yt-downloader-ext.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!
